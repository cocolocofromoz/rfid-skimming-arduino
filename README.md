# rfid-skimming-arduino

Please be aware this project is at ur own risk.

It is my interest to simply try and exploit the Australian system (protocols) for Credit cards. I aim to clone cards using readibly
obtained and cheap "Arduino" hardware/software.
 
I hope to be able to create a self contained device with tha ability to be carried in a small back-pack type bag.

The "Proxmark 3"type items are too expensive and restrictive in nature to suit the changing needs of this field.

I hope at the conclusion of this project to gather contributors etc. granting them oportunity to enter a \
competition to withdraw (in cash) the highest ammount possible from the device we build.

(All funds will be returned to the institutions involved and instruction given to said institutions on how
exploitable their products are.
